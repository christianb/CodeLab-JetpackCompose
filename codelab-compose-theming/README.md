## Color
Material Design defines a number of semantically named [colors](https://material.io/design/color/) which you can use throughout your app.

The [Material color tool](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0) can help to pick colors and create a color palette, even ensuring that the combinations are accessible.

## Create a Theme
To centralize your styling, we recommend creating your own composable that wraps and configures a `MaterialTheme`.
